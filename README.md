# API

Lessons use the following API:

* `main` namespace hosts `application` instance
* `main.application` instance hosts subsystems like `camera`, `mouse`, etc.
* `main.application.camera` instance is a viewport into application's scene
* `main.application.camera.clearColor` property is a clearing color (effectively background color) of the camera
    * **accepts** array of color components in RGB format
        ```lua
        main.application.camera.clearColor = {1, 0, 0}
        ```
    * **returns** array of color components in RGB format
        ```lua
        local color = main.application.camera.clearColor
        print("background color:", color[1], color[2], color[3])
        ```
